ðŸ§  Project Summary for Continue Autopilot
You're helping me finish a project called PathWise, a personal career assistant web app built with:

- Frontend: React (with TypeScript, TailwindCSS)
- Backend: Express (TypeScript)
- Chat functionality using OpenAI API
- Auth via Firebase
- Database via Drizzle / Supabase (if integrated)

Hereâ€™s what I want the assistant to do:

1. Fix any build or runtime issues
   â€“ If `npm run dev` fails, identify and resolve errors automatically.
   â€“ If the site doesnâ€™t load, debug why.

2. Polish and complete features
   - Chat pages (AIChat.tsx, etc.) should:
     - Handle user messages and render AI replies
     - Only show premium features to subscribed users
   - Connect properly to OpenAI and Gemini APIs from .env
   - Ensure assistant roles (chat/edit/apply) are working in Continue

3. Prepare for production
   - Check and clean unused code/files
   - Prepare for deployment (e.g., on Vercel or Replit if applicable)

You can find the project files in folders like:
client/src/pages/
server/lib/
.env

Start by checking if the app runs, then fix anything that breaks and finish whatâ€™s missing.
